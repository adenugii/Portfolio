## 📌 About The Project

This repository hosts the source code for my personal portfolio website. It serves as a digital playground to demonstrate my capability in building **high-performance**, **accessible**, and **interactive** web applications.

The goal was to move away from static templates and build a "living" interface that reflects my specialization in **Front-End Engineering** and **Mobile Development**.

## 🛠️ Built With

I chose this stack to ensure scalability, type safety, and 60fps animations:

- **Core:** [Next.js 15 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/) & [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- **Language:** [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) (Strict Mode)
- **Styling:** [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **Motion:** [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- **Icons:** [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **Deployment:** [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## ⚡ Engineering Highlights

A few technical details implemented in this project:

- **Physics-Based Interactions:** Custom `SpotlightCard` component that tracks mouse coordinates in real-time to create a dynamic lighting effect.
- **Performance Optimization:** Heavy computations (like the dot-grid background) are optimized using event listeners attached to the window object to prevent unnecessary React re-renders.
- **Responsive Design System:** Complex layouts (like the Bento Grid) automatically adapt to mobile viewports with a custom touch-friendly navigation drawer.
- **Scroll Spy Logic:** Custom React Hook (`useActiveSection`) that calculates viewport intersection to update the navigation state dynamically.

## 📬 Contact

I am currently open for **Front-End / Mobile Development Internships**.
